##  What Is Prompt Engineering?

> “The art and science of crafting inputs that guide AI models to produce accurate, useful outputs.”

###  Takeaways:
- You don’t need to be a coder to do it.
- Clear and thoughtful prompts = better AI responses.
- Prompt engineering is a process of **experimentation and refinement**.

##  LLM Output Settings (API only)

If you access AI via APIs (like OpenAI, Google Gemini), you can control:

1. **Output Length**  
   - Controls response size  
   - Higher length = more info (but also higher cost)

2. **Temperature**  
   - Controls randomness  
   - Low temp (0.1–0.3): predictable  
   - High temp (0.7+): creative, diverse answers

3. **Top-p / Top-k Sampling**  
   - Controls **which tokens (words)** are considered  
   - Helps refine creativity vs. precision

##  Prompting Techniques

### 1. **Zero-shot Prompting**  
Prompt with **no examples**.  
 Best for straightforward Q&A tasks.  
**Example:** “Classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral.”

### 2. **One-shot Prompting**  
Give **1 example** to show the format or logic.  
 Helps guide more complex tasks.

### 3. **Few-shot Prompting**  
Give **2+ examples** to teach the model a pattern.  
 Use **relevant**, **diverse**, and **high-quality** examples.

##  System, Contextual & Role Prompting

###  **System Prompting**
- Set the **overall purpose** (e.g., “You are a helpful medical assistant.”)

###  **Contextual Prompting**
- Add background to clarify task  
  (e.g., “Here’s the article, now summarize the key events.”)

###  **Role Prompting**
- Assign personality or style  
  (e.g., “Act like a friendly tour guide.”)

##  Advanced Prompting Techniques

###  **Step-back Prompting**
- Ask a **broad question first**, then narrow down.  
  Helps the AI reason better.

###  **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
- Ask AI to **show its reasoning steps**  
  (like solving a math problem step-by-step)

###  **Self-Consistency**
- Ask the same question multiple times (high temp)  
  → Choose the **most frequent answer**  
   Helps eliminate random errors.

###  **Tree-of-Thought Prompting**
- Ask AI to explore **multiple possible answers**  
  → Then pick the best one.  
   Great for complex decision-making.

###  **ReAct (Reason + Act)**
- Ask AI to reason first, then **take action**  
  (e.g., search for info → refine answer)

###  **Auto Prompt Engineering**
- Let the AI **create prompts for itself**  
  (Yes, AI prompts itself!)

###  **Multimodal Prompting**
- Mix **text + image + code + audio**  
   Needed for apps handling visual or mixed content.

##  Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

1. **Keep it simple**  
   → Clear prompts = Better results

2. **Provide examples**  
   → One-shot / Few-shot is powerful

3. **Be specific about output**  
   → Specify format: text, JSON, table, etc.

4. **Use positive instructions**  
   → Tell AI what to do, not what to avoid

5. **Control token limits**  
   → Prevent long, rambling answers

6. **Experiment!**  
   → Change temperature, phrasing, output format

7. **Document & iterate**  
   → Track what works and improve over time

##  Final Takeaways

- Prompt engineering is about **understanding how AI thinks**, and **guiding it well**.
- Use structured techniques to **control outputs**, **boost reasoning**, and **customize style**.
- Whether you're building apps, analyzing data, or just chatting — better prompts = better results.
